# Car Price Predictor

This repository contains a web application that predicts the price of used cars based on their characteristics. The application uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of used car listings to make the predictions, and it provides a user interface built with Streamlit that allows users to enter the characteristics of a car and get a price estimate.

## Features

Here are some of the features of this application:

- Price prediction: The application can predict the price of a used car based on its make, model, year, mileage, and other characteristics.
- User interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows users to enter the car characteristics and get a price estimate.
- Model performance: The machine learning model used in the application has an accuracy of 90% on the test set.

## Technologies

This application uses the following technologies:

- Python: The programming language used to develop the application and train the machine learning model.
- Streamlit: A Python library for building web applications with simple Python scripts.
- Scikit-learn: A Python library for machine learning.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of this application [here](link-to-live-demo).

## Dataset

The machine learning model used in this application was trained on a dataset of used car listings obtained from [this Kaggle dataset](link-to-kaggle-dataset). The dataset contains information about car make, model, year, mileage, and other characteristics, as well as the price of the car.

## Usage

To use this application, you can clone this repository and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
